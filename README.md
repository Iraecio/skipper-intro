# Prime Auto-Skip

Automatically skip Ads, intros, Credits, etc. on Prime video.

</div>

## Installation

Download the extension here for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/netflix-prime-auto-skip/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflixprime-auto-skip/akaimhgappllmlkadblbdknhbfghdgle).

It will work with other skippers, but it may behave unexpectedly.

## What it does

The script, "skipper.js", is injected into all urls containing "amazon.\*/\*/video" or "netflix.com".

It automatically skips Ads, intros, Credits, recaps, and anything else you don't want to watch on Netflix and Prime video.

## How it works

The addon is observing every mutation of the dom Tree of the Website.

On Netflix it matches the buttons with the data-uia tag containing:

* Intro: player-skip-intro
* Recap: player-skip-recap, player-skip-preplay
* Credits: next-episode-seamless-button
* Inactivity Warning: interrupt-autoplay-continue
* Basic tier ads: matched by css class .ltr-puk2kp and the speed is set to 16x until the ad is over

On Prime video it matches buttons with the Css Classes:

* Intro: skipelement
* Credits: nextupcard-button
* Self promoting ads: .fu4rd6c.f1cw2swo
* Paid Content: .o86fri (yallow text indicates paid films)
  
The freevee ad text contains the ad length which is matched by 

* Freevee ads: .atvwebplayersdk-adtimeindicator-text

and then skipped by forwarding by the ad length -1 second which will fix a lot of issues.
